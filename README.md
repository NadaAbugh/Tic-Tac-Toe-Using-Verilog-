# Tic-Tac-Toe-Using-Verilog
Tic-tac-toe is a classic game with a grid layout of nine cells. Two players, represented by X and O, fill one square with their symbol until one player wins or a draw is reached. A win is achieved when the player fills three adjacent cells in a particular combination with his/her symbol.
One of the projectâ€™s objectives was implementing a working tic tac toe game using Verilog and simulating the code.
